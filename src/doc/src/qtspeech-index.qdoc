   \title Qt Speech
   \brief The Qt Speech module enables access to text-to-speech and
   speech recognition engines

   The module enables a Qt application to support accessibility features such
   as text-to-speech, which is useful for end-users who are visually
   challenged or cannot access the application for whatever reason. The
   most common use case where text-to-speech comes in handy is when the
   end-user is driving and cannot attend the incoming messages on the phone.
   In such a scenario, the messaging application can read out the incoming
   message. Also speech recognition can be utilized in similar cases.
